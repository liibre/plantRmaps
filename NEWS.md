# plantRmaps 0.0.0.9000

* Created a preliminary `world` object to check the workflow. The package is heavier than it should but installation is OK. By setting plantRmaps::world, shares_border() passes all the tests, even the French Guiana problem n_n

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
